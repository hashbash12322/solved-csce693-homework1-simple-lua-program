 <li> Download and compile the Lua source code for version 5.3.5 (on website) using your own handwritten Makefile to produce 3 artifacts using the following target names: 1) “lua” – the Lua REPL interpreter (filename: lua), 2) “luac” – the Lua compiler (filename:</li>

</ol>

luac), and finally, 3) “liblua” – a static lua linking library (filename: liblua.a).  One additional target called “all” should compile and link all the artifacts as needed above.

<ol>

 <li>make lua – should build the lua REPL interactive console driving application</li>

 <li>make luac – should create the lua compiler application.</li>

 <li>make liblua – should create the static linking library</li>

 <li>make all – should produce all of the above</li>
